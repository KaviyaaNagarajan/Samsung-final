# War Simulation Tasks
simulate_competitive_moves:
  description: >
    Simulate a focal company's competitive moves and counter-moves
    using game theory principles in response to actions by competitors
    in the target market.

    For the given scenario, analyze:
    1. Initial competitor move (pricing, feature launch, or marketing shift)
    2. The focal company's possible response options
    3. Likely competitor counter-moves
    4. Game theory analysis (dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium)
    5. Timing considerations (first-mover vs fast-follower)

    Ensure the simulation considers:
    - Flagship and mid-range product line positioning
    - Competitor incentives and constraints
    - Market timing and launch cycles
    - The focal company's ecosystem or product advantages
  expected_output: >
    A decision brief for the focal company including:
    - Competitor move summary
    - Recommended strategic response
    - Expected competitor counter-response
    - Dominant strategy / Nash equilibrium insight
    - Confidence score (0–1)

    Provide estimates for:
    - Revenue impact (₹ / % range)
    - Change in adoption rate
    - Market share movement
    - Impact timeline (30 / 60 / 90 days, 1 year)

risk_assessment:
  description: >
    Conduct a competitive risk assessment for Samsung Galaxy smartphones
    based on the simulated competitive scenario.

    Identify:
    1. Worst-case outcomes (price wars, margin erosion, brand dilution)
    2. Aggressive competitor retaliation risks
    3. Supply chain or inventory risks
    4. Regulatory or market sentiment risks
    5. Long-term strategic risks to Samsung's brand and ecosystem

    For each identified risk, assess:
    - Severity (High / Medium / Low)
    - Probability
    - Business impact
    - Early warning indicators
    - Mitigation and contingency strategies
